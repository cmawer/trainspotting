In this repo, you can find my PyCon 2016 talk (better rendered for viewing [here](cmawer.github.io/trainspotting)) in the files `index.ipynb` and `index.html`. You can find the video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC00XWdl-ms). 

Also in this repo is the accompanying blog post (better rendered at for viewing [here](http://cmawer.github.io/trainspotting/trainspotting-blog.html)).
